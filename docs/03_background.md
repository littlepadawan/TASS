# Background

TASS was developed as part of a Bachelor's thesis at the Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, Sweden, during the spring of 2024, in collaboration with the Department of Physics and Astronomy.

TASS simplifies the interaction with Turbospectrum, a tool for generating synthetic spectra. Running Turbospectrum typically requires manual configuration and invocation for each set of input parameters. When producing a large number of synthetic spectra, this process becomes unmanageable. Therefor, there was a need to enhance the usability of and interaction with Turbospectrum, facilitating efficient generation of substantial amounts of synthetic spectra.

TASS enables automated generation of synthetic spectral data with varied stellar parameters. It was initially designed to handle five stellar parameters: effective temperature (T<sub>eff</sub>), surface gravity (log g), metallicity ([Fe/H]), and the abundances of magnesium and calcium. However, the program is designed to be easily extensible to accommodate additional parameters in the future.
